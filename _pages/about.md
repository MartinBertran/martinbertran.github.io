I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon Web Services (AWS) working on Responsible AI. My current research explores data-efficient techniques to measure and improve calibration and veracity in large language models, and on building scalable pipelines to measure potential privacy issues in deployed models. More recently, I'm interested in measuring the abilities of LLM agents to negotiate and act in the best interests of their users, and on using alignment tools to improve the veracity of LLM generations. During my PhD I worked on making minimax fair, and adopted a statistics-centered approach to solve problems in a simple and principled manner.

Before joining AWS, I received a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering (2022) from Duke University where I was avised by Guillermo Sapiro. Before that, I obtained a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering from the Universidad de la Republica Oriental del Uruguay.

On my down time, you'll find me hiking, climbing, or playing around with cats.
